I am a midweight PHP developer, working for British Cycling. I strive to become a better developer, improving my skill set and development practices.

Back in 2014 I was a Bar manager and decided I could do more with my life. In October I handed my notice in and started to teach myself to code. Come January the next year I was working at Webantic, a digital agency.

Since then I have been constantly learning and improving, and I believe that in an industry that doesn't stop neither should I.
