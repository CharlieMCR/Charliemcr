A static site made with a customised Hugo theme.

The first site I created was a Laravel based content management system. As proud as I was with this application, I always wanted to refactor the whole thing. After many attempted starts I realised that my free time was more valuable to me than making another application I needed to maintain.

Come 2017 I decided to keep it simple, and use a third party tool to make life easier for me.

Static site generators have been something I've wanted to become more familiar with. Jekyll and Hugo were the two I'd been hearing the most about.

With keeping it simple I opted to go for Hugo and started customising the stock Ananke theme.

As for deployment, I lept at the chance to give deployer a go. Justifying the cost for my Jenkins server.
